    # Arc Runner Group Strategy (Blacksmith-like service):
    # - Shared pool of runners with customer/capability labels
    # - GitHub App manages dynamic provisioning and cleanup
    # - Labels enable routing: [self-hosted, nix, linux, customer-ogt]
    # Current: Using mikkihugo-runners group
    # Future: Switch to explicit labels when GitHub App ready
